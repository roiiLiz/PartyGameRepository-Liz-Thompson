Game Title & Concept -
My game is called Virus Catcher, where you play as the Computer Defender taking down viruses before they can spread and destroy your computer. The concept originally started as a drag-n-drop minigame where you dragged virus files into a recycling bin, however that idea was dropped due to some technical difficulties.
Gameplay -
The gameplay of Virus Catcher is very simple; you move using WASD, and your objective is to catch 5 viruses before the 10 seconds pass and they infect your computer. Enemies, known as viruses, spawn randomly on the screen every second for 10 seconds.
Basic Requirements -
Virus Catcher meets the basic requirements of being a single player game made in Unity that uses WASD movement and has at most 10 seconds of gameplay. The win / loss screens last roughly 2 seconds, and the main menuâ€™s simplicity and micro-tutorial can easily be understood in seconds. There are two endgame states, winning by collecting 5 viruses before 10 seconds have passed, and losing by failing to collect the viruses in time. So far as I know, the game is not a clone of a Unity tutorial.
Audio Requirements -
During gameplay & in the main menu, background music plays for the player. Viruses are given a pickup sound effect to indicate to the player their significance, and there are two distinct sounds for winning and losing.
The audio is all from royalty free sources, all three of the in game sound effects are from Mixkit.co, and the both background musics for the main menu and the game itself are from Kevin Macleod.
Visual Requirements -
The background, character sprite, enemy sprite, and enemy particle effects were created by me using Piskelapp.com. There is a background that is not the default, there is a custom sprite made for the character, a custom sprite made for the enemies, as well as a particle system created for the enemies. Furthermore, there is a UI to indicate both score and time left.
